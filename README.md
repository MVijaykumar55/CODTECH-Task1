Overview of the Project

Project: Python Programming on a Simple calculator in our daily doing the basic calculations

Objective
This project aims to develop a basic calculator application using Python Programming on a Simple Calculator. This calculator will be capable of performing fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Implement and test functions for each arithmetic operation.

Key Activities
	Function: Four functions perform the basic arithmetic operations.
	User input: Prompt the user to enter two numbers. Validating user input to ensure numbers are provided.
	Operation Selection: Displaying a menu of arithmetic operations.
	Performing calculation: Executing the selected arithmetic operation using functions.
	Result display: The result of the operation is printed to the user.
Technologies Used
	Python: A high-level, primary programming language known for its simple calculations used in calculator and readability.
	Standard Input/Output: ‘Input()’ is used to capture user input from the command line and ‘print()’ is used to display results and output to the user.
	Functions: Functions are defined using the ‘def’ keyword. Each function encapsulates a specific task, such as performing an arithmetic operation like ‘add’, ‘subtract’, ‘multiply’ and ‘divide’.
	Error handling: ‘try’ and ‘except’ are used to handle potential errors, such as invalid user Input.
	Control Structures: Control Structures are like Conditional Statements and Loops.
•	Control Structures are used to make decisions 
based on user input, such as selecting the appropriate arithmetic operation.
•	Loops are used the ‘while’ loop could be used to prompt the user until valid input is provided continuously.
	Data Types: The ‘float’ converts user input into floating-point numbers, allowing the calculator to handle decimal numbers and perform precise arithmetic  operations. This is essential  for arithmetic operations involving decimal values.
